                        <p>Walt Disney World is an entertainment resot complex in Bay Lake and Lake Buena Vista, Florida, United States. Walt Disney World was designed to supplement Disneyland in Anaheim California. The resort has four theme parks: Magic Kingdom, Disney's Hollywood Studios, Epcot, and Disney's Animal Kingdom. The Magic Kingdom was the first theme park to open in the complex (1972), followed by Epcot (1982), Disnet's Hollywood Studios (1989), and lastly, Disney's Animal Kingdom (1998).<br><br>

                            <p>I am currently a Graduate student at University of Washington. When I was a kid, my parents took me to Disneylad Hongkong, Japan, and the one in California. I have been obsessed with theme parks in general since I love thrill attractions, but I always managed to go to Disneyland in California at least once a year, until Covid hits. I have never gone to the Disneyworld in Florida until recently (March 2022) because Florida is pretty far. I always thought that Disneyworld in Florida is pretty overrated and I thought all disney theme parks would have similar vibes, but I was wrong. When I visited Disneyworld in March 2022, I felt like it was magical. I know disneyworld is definitely the happiest place on earth. I started watching more disney films now, and my day consists of watching youtubes about disneyworld's vlogs. My favorite park is definitely Disney's Animal Kingdom! And I would suggest you all to check out Disneyworlds on-site resorts just because you can take advantage of 30-mins early theme park entry and Disneyworlds have lots of deals for places to stay onsite throughout the year (I recommend Pop Century Resort because it's budget friendly and it has access to Disney's Skyliner). My recommendation in terms of best time to visit is anytime other than school break or big holiday season. So, if it's possible, try planning your disneyworld trip for around Mid Jan-Mid March, Mid April-Mid May, End of Aug-Mid Nov. Take into accounts that there are 4 theme parks in total (excluding the water theme parks), so I suggest to enjoy 1 theme park per day, so this trip would be around 5-7 days in total (depending where you are traveling from). </p>
